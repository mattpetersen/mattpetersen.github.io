    <h1>Matt Petersen</h1>
    <p>I want to understand neural networks thoroughly, and help you do so too. Throughout this blog, we will focus on questions of <i>why</i>.

    <ul>
        <li><i>Why</i> does layer width matter?</li>
        <li><i>Why</i> does our network fail to converge?</li>
        <li><i>Why</i> should we normalize batches?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There are lots of tutorials about <i>how</i> to code neural networks, but they often leave behind a trail of <i>why</i>'s. Now, that's not to say we'll forgo <i>how</i>'s. In fact, we'll build our very own neural network from scratch in Python, much the way Michael Nielsen does in his excellent <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html">online book</a>. The difference is that we'll use more graphical illustrations, and what I believe to be friendlier notation. After the basics, we'll dive into coding bleeding-edge papers together, explaining the key insights in terms of concepts we've already covered.</p>
