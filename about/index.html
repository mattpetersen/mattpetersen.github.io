    <p>I want to understand neural networks thoroughly, and help you do so too. This blog will focus on questions of <i>why</i>.

    <ul>
        <li><i>Why</i> does layer width matter?</li>
        <li><i>Why</i> does our network fail to converge?</li>
        <li><i>Why</i> should we normalize batches?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There are lots of tutorials on <i>how</i> to code neural networks, but few will justify each step. This blog will include some code, along with "intuitively rigorous" math. We plan to step through an entire neural network from scratch, much the way Michael Nielsen does in his excellent <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html">online book</a>. The difference is that we'll use more graphical illustrations, and what I believe to be friendlier notation. After the basics, we'll dive into coding bleeding-edge papers together, explaining the key insights in terms of concepts we've already covered.</p>
